This simulation setup was developed for the purpose of testing and validating the performance of autonomous driving algorithms for the [AiX Lab](https://www.aixlab.ca) at the University of Western. The goal was to create a budget friendly and easy to use simulation environment that would provide an emersive driving experience to test and validate the performance of autonomous driving algorithms as well as collect driver data.
