This simulation setup was developed for the purpose of testing and validating the performance of autonomous driving algorithms for the [AiX Lab](https://www.aixlab.ca) at the University of Western. The goal was to create a buget friendly and easy to use simulation environment that could be used to provide an emersive driving experience to test and validate the performance of autonomous driving algorithms as well as collect driver data.
