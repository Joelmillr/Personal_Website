My first published article! This paper is a review of takeovers in autonomous vehicles. My goal
was to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art in the field. I also
wanted to identify the gaps in the literature and suggest future research directions. The paper
was published in the Open Journal of Vehicle Technology and is available [here](https://doi.org/10.1109/ojvt.2024.3443630).
